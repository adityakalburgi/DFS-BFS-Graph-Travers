          <h2>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
          <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch
            before backtracking. It's like exploring a maze by following each path to its end before returning to try a
            different route.</p>
          <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of nodes</li>
            <li>Memory-efficient for certain types of problems</li>
            <li>Can be used to detect cycles in a graph</li>
            <li>Useful for topological sorting and solving puzzles</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
          <p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the
            present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level. It's like exploring a maze by
            examining all paths of a certain length before moving to longer paths.</p>
          <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses a queue to keep track of nodes</li>
            <li>Guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs</li>
            <li>Useful for finding the shortest path and in peer-to-peer networks</li>
            <li>Effective for searching in social networks</li>
          </ul>
